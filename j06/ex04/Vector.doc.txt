<- Vector ----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Vertex class represents a point in space.

An instance can be constructed from a class Vertex 'dist':
new Vector( array("dest" => $dest);

And with optional class Vertex 'orig':
new Vector( array("orig" => $orig, dest" => $dest);

The class provides the following methods:

float magnitude():
Returns the length (or "norm") of the vector.

Vector normalize():
Returns the normalized vector. If the vector is already normalized, returns a fresh copy of the vector.

Vector add(Vector $rhs):
Returns the vector sum of two vectors.

Vector sub(Vector $rhs):
Returns the vector difference of the two vectors.

Vector opposite():
Returns the opposite vector.

Vector scalarProduct($k):
Returns the product of the vector with a scalar.

float dotProduct(Vector $rhs):
Returns the dot product of two vectors.

float cos(Vector $rhs):
Returns the cosine of the angle between two vectors.

Vector crossProduct(Vector $rhs):
Returns the cross product of two vectors.

The class saves this elements.
