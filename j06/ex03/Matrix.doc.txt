<- Matrix ----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Matrix class represents a matrix.

An instance can be constructed from a class Vertex 'preset' with one of values next:
IDENTITY, SCALE, RX, RY, TRANSLATION, PROJECTION.

When value is IDENTITY, scale value is necessary (factor of scale).

When value is RX, RY or RZ (rotation rotation along axes), angle value is necessary (in degree).

When value is TRANSLATION, vtc vector is necessary.

When value is PROJECTION, fov value, ratio value (width/height of the image),
near value (near clipping plane of the projection) and far value (far clipping plane of the projection) are necessary.

The class provides the following methods:

Matrix mult(Matrix $rhs):
Returns a new result matrix multiplication of two matrices.

Vertex transformVertex(Vertex $vtx):
Returns a result of the new vertex of the vertex by the transformation matrix.
